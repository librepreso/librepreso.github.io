# librepreso.github.io

This is the landing page for **librepreso**, a space where I share ideas, links, and experiments.

It's not a blog or portfolio — it's a simple, creative placeholder to connect some of the work I’m doing across writing, coding, and learning.

Visit the page: [https://librepreso.github.io](https://librepreso.github.io)
